# Case Study of JPMCoin by Ankita Kapoor

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company?- JPMorgan JPMCoin

* When was the company incorporated? JP Morgan Chase was incorporated in 1942. JPM Coin (a digital token that will be used to settle transactions between clients and wholesale payments business) was launched in February 2019, it was the first cryptocurrency issued by a US bank.  
* 

* Who are the founders of the company? Over the years JP Morgan Chase has acquired and merged with many banks and financial institutions to become the modern day JP Morgan Chase. The many founders of the modern day JPMC are Balthazar P. Melick (Chemical Bank), John Pierpont Morgan (J.P. Morgan & Co.), John Thompson (Chase National Bank), Aaron Burr (The Manhattan Company). 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Although JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon at first, expressed caution with bitcoin. The company soon realized that in order to remain competitive in the financial sector they needed to be able to compete with the speed of cross-border/country financial transactions that emerging financial technologies allowed as wire transfers (their traditional method to move money) across borders took significantly more time. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? JP Morgan is funded by the financial services it provides through it's four main lines of business i.e, asset wealth management for high net worth individuals, fees on trading using their investment bank, commercial, and consumer banking. The net worth of JP Morgan as of Q3 2020 is $9.4 billion through these four main lines of businesses. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? The project is trying to solve a speed problem with cross border/country transactions as wire transfers are too slow to compete with the new ways to facilitate financial transactions using fintech at a faster speed. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? JPMCoin is only available to JPM’s institutional clients. Since they are targeting customers that do primarily business to business transactions (due to assumed frequency of cross-border transactions), assuming JPMCoin continues to do transactions only for their institutional clients the market size for JP Morgan would be $149 billion. 
   
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? JPM Coin is a stablecoin, it's a fiat currency that has a 1:1 representation with US dollars held in institutional bank’s accounts (aka its value is backed by the US dollar). Umar Farooq, JP Morgan's head of digital treasury services and blockchain, describes the coin as “designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology.”


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? JPMCoin is in the B2B segment, focusing mainly on institutional clients that do many cross-border payments. Their market size is about $149 billion. Since JPM Coin is sponsored by JP MOrgan it comes with the guarantees of the name brand, including FDIC insurance, and access to the FED daily overdraft in times of stress. JPMCoin started to ensure their cross border payments remain competitive with competitors using bitcoin to make the transactions faster for clients. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? The major trends and innovations with B2B cross border transactions have been a push towards more efficient, effective, and fast-paced transactions. With this trend, the biggest innovations have been incorporating more online banking options, automating processes to ensure less errors (such as factoring out human error by making processes tech based), and incorporating bitcoin to ensure more efficient, effective and faster transactions. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Major companies in this domain would be companies that are in a similar bracket to JPMorgan Chase such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo. However, from a JPMCoin perspective the comparable players are Libra and TON. The competitive edge that Libra and TON could have is that they are open to a much wider audience than JPMCoin. TransferWise, Revolut, and Goldman Sachs all are now targeting the international payments stage. However, the brand loyalty, and relative low risk with JPMCoin guarantees stability which is very attractive to institutions. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? The business impact of this has been a profitable market. As cross border transactions increase in our very global economy the scope for growth in this type of environment is very stable and the profits are certain. Revenue growth of the B2B segment is pretty steady, until 2018 the sector grew at 4% and is expected to grow at 3%. Due to the stability of JPMCoin, this offers institutionalized investors a surefire way to make their investments using bitcoin in a guaranteed way which could spur growth with businesses that are interested in doing exchanges with bitcoin with "lower risk" as it comes with the guarantees of the JPMorgan brand. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Metrics in these types of cross border transactions are measured by volume of transactions and monetary value of the transactions. JPMorgan's brand, the FDIC guarantee, and the stability of using bitcoin with these transactions, helps institutions make more efficient payments. Smaller competitors are just not able to compete with the brand loyalty, and the value add on the guarantees that JP Morgan's name brand is able to bring to the table. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? As stated above, JP Morgan's brand loyalty, their scope for larger scale money movements, and their commitment to guaranteeing a safe transaction that is efficient, effective, and fast-paced; is helping them remain a big wolf in this game. As they get larger if they expand to other areas they'd become even more attractive to global institutions. 



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?  Marketing full utilization for JPMCoin for instant settlements, would make it more attractive for large scale corporations with a global presence. If institutions would be able to instantly do cross-border/cross-company transactions, it'd make payments more efficient and would ensure that companies would not have to incur a net settlement over longer periods of time. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? Essentially if JPMCoin makes itself more attractive to corporations with a global presence they'd be getting larger money movement transactions that they could put set large fees on. 

In this case, the blockchain on which JPM Coin operates could interoperate with the said blockchain to enable instant, atomic settlement of securities. Smart contracts can also automate interest payments, giving JPM clients faster settlement time than competitors.
These future use cases are only a glimpse of what is possible with JPM Coin. But they are still relatively far from production as they require significant coordination among different stakeholders, such as central banks, stock exchanges, individual commercial banks, etc. But with the ecosystem maturing, cross-chain solutions becoming more prevalent, and entities like JPMorgan leading the effort, we will definitely see more enterprise blockchain adoption going forward.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? If the block chain that JPPMCoin operations on would interoperate with that blockchain to enable instant settlement, JPMC institutionalized clients would have faster settlement time than competitors. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? As cross-chain solutions become more widely used this type of adoption would help JPMC stand out amongst its competitors to do early adoption.
